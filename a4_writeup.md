# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe? 

creating the objects was probibly the hardest part out of the clear function, outcomes, class, ect.. but this assignement was a simple and great way to learn about objects.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

assign the computer to a O or X and give it a function to decide which moves the computer should play by using if functions.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

I might use, if functions to make the computer responded to the opponents moves in the best way possible and if they are moving first. I would assign it to move to a corner or middle.
